1. **EC2 Storage Options:**
    - **Elastic Block Store (EBS):** Provides persistent block storage that you can attach to EC2 instances. Data in EBS volumes persists even if the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated.
    - **Instance Store:** Offers local storage that is physically attached to the EC2 instance. Data in instance store volumes is ephemeral and does not persist when the instance is stopped or terminated.
    - **Elastic File System (EFS):** A serverless network file system designed for sharing files among Linux-based EC2 instances within a region.
2. **Use Cases for EC2 Storage:**
    - EBS is suitable for persistent, frequently accessed data.
    - Instance store provides ultra-low-latency storage for temporary data or replicated data across multiple instances.
    - EFS is used for shared directories among Linux-based EC2 instances.
3. **Storage Gateway:**
    - Storage Gateway is a hybrid storage service that bridges on-premises environments with AWS cloud storage. It allows you to keep some data on-premises and some in the cloud, making it suitable for data backup, cost reduction, and low-latency access scenarios.
4. **AWS Backup:**
    - AWS Backup is a centralized backup service that helps you schedule, execute, and manage backups across various AWS services, including EC2, EBS, and more. It enables data protection and recovery strategies.

**As you prepare for the Certified Cloud Practitioner exam, remember to understand the use cases, strengths, and limitations of each storage service. This knowledge will help you make informed decisions when designing storage solutions for different scenarios on AWS.**
