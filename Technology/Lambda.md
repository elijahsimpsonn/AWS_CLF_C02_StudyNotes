**AWS Lambda** is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows developers to run code (functions) in the cloud without the need to manage servers or infrastructure. Lambda is designed to make it easier to build applications that respond quickly to new information, changes in data, or incoming events. Here are some key points to understand about AWS Lambda:

- **Serverless Compute Service:** Lambda is often referred to as a "serverless" service because developers can focus solely on writing code, and AWS takes care of the underlying infrastructure. You don't need to provision or manage servers, which simplifies the development process.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** AWS Lambda functions are event-driven, meaning they can be triggered by various events or actions. These events can include changes in data stored in AWS services, incoming HTTP requests, or custom events from other AWS resources.
- **Supported Programming Languages:** Lambda supports multiple programming languages, including but not limited to Java, Go, PowerShell, Node.js, C#, Python, and Ruby. This flexibility allows developers to choose the language that best suits their application.
- **Flexible Development:** You can write Lambda functions using your preferred code editor or integrated development environment (IDE). Functions can be authored locally and then uploaded to AWS Lambda or written directly in the AWS Lambda console.
- **Scalability:** Lambda functions are highly scalable. They automatically scale in response to the number of incoming requests or events. You can run thousands of functions concurrently without worrying about managing the infrastructure.
- **Event Sources:** Lambda functions can be triggered by various event sources, including AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon SNS, AWS Step Functions, and more. Custom events can also be created to trigger Lambda functions.
- **Execution Environment:** Lambda functions run in an isolated execution environment, which means that the code you write does not share resources with other functions. Each function is executed independently.
- **Timeout and Execution Limits:** Lambda functions have a maximum execution time limit of 15 minutes per invocation. If a function runs for too long, it will be terminated. AWS provides options for handling longer tasks, such as using AWS Step Functions.
- **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing:** AWS Lambda follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You are charged based on the actual compute time used and the number of requests made to your functions. AWS Lambda offers an "Always Free" tier with 1 million free requests per month.
- **Use Cases:** AWS Lambda is used for a wide range of use cases, including real-time data processing, building serverless applications, automating workflows, handling HTTP API requests, performing data transformations, and more.

In summary, AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that empowers developers to build highly scalable and event-driven applications without the need to manage servers. It offers flexibility in terms of supported languages, is cost-effective, and integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, making it a foundational component of modern cloud applications.

**As you prepare for the exam, remember to understand the serverless and event-driven nature of Lambda, its use cases, supported programming languages, and the pricing model. Additionally, practice creating Lambda functions and configuring triggers in the AWS Management Console to gain hands-on experience.**
