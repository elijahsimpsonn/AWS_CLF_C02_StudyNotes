1. **AWS Lambda Overview:**
    - AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service.
    - Developers can focus on writing code (functions) without managing servers, provisioning, or scaling.
    - Functions can be authored in various popular programming languages.
2. **Serverless and Event-Driven:**
    - Serverless means AWS manages the underlying infrastructure, and you only pay for the compute time used.
    - AWS Lambda functions can be triggered by events, such as changes in data, file uploads, or HTTP requests.
3. **Real-World Use Cases:**
    - Lambda is commonly used for real-time file processing, sending emails, backend business logic, and building serverless applications.
    - It is a key component of serverless architectures.
4. **Lambda Features:**
    - Supports multiple programming languages, including Java, Go, PowerShell, Node.js, C#, Python, and Ruby.
    - Code can be authored locally and uploaded or written directly in the AWS Lambda console.
    - Functions can be executed in response to various events.
    - Functions have a 15-minute timeout limit for execution.
5. **Creating a Lambda Function:**
    - You can create Lambda functions using the AWS Management Console.
    - Functions are written in code, and you can configure triggers and event sources.
    - AWS Lambda provides test capabilities to validate function behavior.
6. **Lambda Pricing Model:**
    - Lambda pricing is based on the duration of function execution and the number of requests.
    - You pay for the actual compute time used.
    - AWS Lambda offers an "Always Free" tier that includes 1 million free requests per month.

**As you prepare for the exam, remember to understand the serverless and event-driven nature of Lambda, its use cases, supported programming languages, and the pricing model. Additionally, practice creating Lambda functions and configuring triggers in the AWS Management Console to gain hands-on experience.**
