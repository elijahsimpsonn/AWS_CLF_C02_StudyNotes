1. **AWS Fargate:**
    - Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers.
    - It allows you to manage containers using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS).
    - Fargate scales automatically and is serverless, eliminating the need to manage servers or clusters.
2. **Amazon Lightsail:**
    - Lightsail is designed for small projects and simplifies the deployment of resources.
    - It offers preconfigured applications like WordPress websites.
    - Lightsail provides an easy-to-use interface for users with limited cloud experience.
    - It comes with a low, predictable monthly fee, starting as low as $3.50.
3. **AWS Outposts:**
    - Outposts enables you to run AWS cloud services in your on-premises data center.
    - It supports workloads that need to remain on-premises due to latency or data sovereignty requirements.
    - AWS delivers and installs servers in your data center, allowing you to access cloud services and APIs on-premises.
4. **AWS Batch:**
    - Batch is used for processing large workloads in smaller chunks or batches.
    - It is typically employed for long-running jobs.
    - You can run hundreds or thousands of batch processing jobs, and AWS Batch dynamically provisions instances based on the workload.

Remember these key features and use cases for each service as you prepare for the exam:

- **Fargate** is serverless and ideal for managing containers.
- **Lightsail** simplifies resource deployment for small projects.
- **Outposts** supports hybrid deployments and on-premises workloads.
- **Batch** is used for processing large workloads in smaller batches.

**Understanding when and how to use these additional compute services is important for designing and implementing AWS solutions effectively.**
