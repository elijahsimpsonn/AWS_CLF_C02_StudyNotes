**Cloud Computing Basics:**

- Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet. It's a way to store data and share applications using remote servers. Data and applications are stored on real servers, which can be in your data center or hosted by a cloud provider like AWS. Servers are powerful computers that handle requests for websites and applications.

**AWS Infrastructure:**

- AWS operates thousands of servers grouped together in data centers. Data centers are where your data and applications are hosted. AWS provides many high-level services to access and share data and applications over the internet.

**AWS Categories:**

- AWS services are categorized into:
    - **Compute** (e.g., EC2 and Lambda)
    - **Networking** (e.g., VPC and Direct Connect)
    - **Storage** (e.g., S3 and EBS)
    - **Analytics** (e.g., Athena and Redshift)
    - **Development** (e.g., Cloud9 and CodeCommit)
    - **Security** (e.g., IAM and Macie)
    - **Databases** (e.g., RDS and DynamoDB)

**[AWS Whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/aws-overview.pdf):**

- **Overview of Amazon Web Services** is an important resource. It lists AWS services by category. **It is highly recommended to read before the exam and review it again before the exam day.**

**Virtualization in Cloud Computing:**

- Virtualization divides physical server hardware into smaller units called virtual machines (VMs). Each VM functions as an independent server with its own OS, memory, storage, and networking access.

**Pricing Models:**

- AWS offers on-demand and pay-as-you-go pricing models.
    - **On-demand:** No long-term commitments or upfront payments, pay only when you use services.
    - **Pay-as-you-go:** Pay by the hour or even by the second for what you use.

**Exam Preparation Tips:**

- **Remember the service categories, e.g., Lambda and EC2 are compute services.**
- **Read the "Overview of Amazon Web Services" whitepaper (72 pages) thoroughly before the exam**. - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/aws-overview.pdf
